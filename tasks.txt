Phase 1: Project Setup
-Initialize the Django project – Create a new Django project and set up the necessary configurations.
-Set up a Django app – Create an app for handling predictions.
-Set up a virtual environment – Ensure dependencies are properly managed.
-Set up Git and version control – Initialize a Git repository for project tracking.

Phase 2: Basic Web Pages
-Design and implement the homepage – Show yesterday's prediction outcomes as the main content.
-Create an about page – Explain how the predictions work and pricing.
-Set up static files (CSS, JS, images) – Style the website for a professional look.


Phase 3: Database & Models
-Create models for predictions – Store match details, prediction status, and results.
-Create models for users – If not using Django’s built-in authentication, implement custom user models.
-Create models for transactions – Store payment details for future automated access.
-Migrate the database – Apply migrations and test database interactions.


Phase 4: Predictions & Access Control
-Implement a system to display yesterday’s predictions – Retrieve and display outcomes.
-Create an authentication system – Allow users to register and log in.
-Set up restricted content access – Users must pay to unlock today’s predictions.
-Design the user dashboard – Allow users to see their past payments and unlocked predictions.


Phase 5: Payment Integration
-Implement a manual payment verification system – Users confirm payments manually (automated later).
-Integrate automated mobile payment verification – Handle payments dynamically to grant access.
-Send confirmation messages – Notify users when payment is received.


Phase 6: Admin & Management
-Set up the Django admin panel – Manage users, predictions, and transactions.
-Create an admin dashboard – Easily update daily predictions and payment status.


Phase 7: Deployment & Optimization
-Deploy locally using Docker – Containerize the Django app with PostgreSQL or MySQL.
-Host the web app online – Use a server to make the app accessible externally.
-Optimize for performance – Improve database queries and caching.
